	abstract = {Wikipedia is one of the most successful examples of massive collaborative content development. However, many of the mechanisms and procedures that it uses are still unknown in detail. For instance, how equal (or unequal) are the contributions to it has been discussed in the last years, with no conclusive results. In this paper, we study exactly that aspect by using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients, very well known instruments to economists. We analyze the trends in the inequality of distributions for the ten biggest language editions of Wikipedia, and their evolution over time. As a result, we have found large differences in the number of contributions by different authors (something also observed in free, open source software development), and a trend to stable patterns of inequality in the long run.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06580},
	abstract = {At least since Priestley's 1765 Chart of Biography, large numbers of individual person records have been used to illustrate aggregate patterns of cultural history. Wikidata, the structured database sister of Wikipedia, currently contains about 2.7 million explicit person records, across all language versions of the encyclopedia. These individuals, notable according to Wikipedia editing criteria, are connected via millions of hyperlinks between their respective Wikipedia articles. This situation provides us with the chance to go beyond the illustration of an idiosyncratic subset of individuals, as in the case of Priestly. In this work we summarize the overlap of nationalities and occupations, based on their co-occurrence in Wikidata individuals. We construct networks of co-occurring nationalities and occupations, provide insights into their respective community structure, and apply the results to select and color chronologically structured subsets of a large network of individuals, connected by Wikipedia hyperlinks. While the imagined communities of nationality are much more discrete in terms of co-occurrence than occupations, our quantifications reveal the existing overlap of nationality as much less clear-cut than in case of occupational domains. Our work contributes to a growing body of research using biographies of notable persons to analyze cultural processes.},

	abstract = {Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit, has been enormously successful. But while it is read nearly equally by women and men, women are only 8.5 to 12.6\% of those who edit or write Wikipedia articles. We analyzed coverage of Wikipedia’s gender gap by 42 U.S. news organizations and blogs as well as 1,336 comments posted online by readers. We also interviewed Wikimedia Foundation executive director Sue Gardner. Commentators questioned Wikipedia’s epistemology and culture and associated the gap with societal issues and/or (perceived) gender differences regarding time management, self-confidence, and expertise, as well as personality and interests. Yet, many commentators denied the gap was a problem; they blamed women for not joining, suggested it was women’s choice, or mocked girly interests. The belittling of the disparity as feminist ideology arguably betrays an antifeminist backlash.},

	abstract = {Contributing to history has never been as easy as it is today. Anyone with access to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free encyclopedia. Wikipedia, available in many languages, is one of the most visited websites in the world and arguably one of the primary sources of knowledge on the Web. However, not everyone is contributing to Wikipedia from a diversity point of view; several groups are severely underrepresented. One of those groups is women, who make up approximately 16\% of the current contributor community, meaning that most of the content is written by men. In addition, although there are specific guidelines of verifiability, notability, and neutral point of view that must be adhered by Wikipedia content, these guidelines are supervised and enforced by men. In this paper, we propose that gender bias is not about participation and representation only, but also about characterization of women. We approach the analysis of gender bias by defining a methodology for comparing the characterizations of men and women in biographies in three aspects: meta-data, language, and network structure. Our results show that, indeed, there are differences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are reflected from the off-line world documented by Wikipedia, but other differences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We contextualize these differences in feminist theory and discuss their implications for Wikipedia policy.},

	abstract = {Opt-in surveys are the most widespread method used to study participation in online communities, but produce biased results in the absence of adjustments for non-response. A 2008 survey conducted by the Wikimedia Foundation and United Nations University at Maastricht is the source of a frequently cited statistic that less than 13\% of Wikipedia contributors are female. However, the same study suggested that only 39.9\% of Wikipedia readers in the US were female – a finding contradicted by a representative survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center conducted less than two months later. Combining these two datasets through an application and extension of a propensity score estimation technique used to model survey non-response bias, we construct revised estimates, contingent on explicit assumptions, for several of the Wikimedia Foundation and United Nations University at Maastricht claims about Wikipedia editors. We estimate that the proportion of female US adult editors was 27.5\% higher than the original study reported (22.7\%, versus 17.8\%), and that the total proportion of female editors was 26.8\% higher (16.1\%, versus 12.7\%).},

	abstract = {Wikipedia is a community-created encyclopedia that contains information about notable people from different countries, epochs and disciplines and aims to document the world's knowledge from a neutral point of view. However, the narrow diversity of the Wikipedia editor community has the potential to introduce systemic biases such as gender biases into the content of Wikipedia. In this paper we aim to tackle a sub problem of this larger challenge by presenting and applying a computational method for assessing gender bias on Wikipedia along multiple dimensions. We find that while women on Wikipedia are covered and featured well in many Wikipedia language editions, the way women are portrayed starkly differs from the way men are portrayed. We hope our work contributes to increasing awareness about gender biases online, and in particular to raising attention to the different levels in which gender biases can manifest themselves on the web.},

\section{Introduction}
Problematize introduction and make obvious need.

Landscape of ways in which Wikipedia shows bias, and Landscape of biases.

Our first observation is from September 17th 2014, and latest is January 3rd 2016. Although our dataset is now updated weekly following the official data dumps, automation was not completed until June 28th 2015, and so there is a window missing from October 2014 to June 2015. 
\section{Description}

The Data is collected by (I'm sure I've written this somewhere already).

Total human in wikidata increased from $5,869,606$ to $6,999,542$.

\end{figure}

We should also be curious to the data quality of the increasing humans. One way to think about this is about the how much data is accompanying these human entries. 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
\toprule
{} &  citizenship &  place of birth &  ethnic group &  at least 1 site link &    gender \\
\midrule
